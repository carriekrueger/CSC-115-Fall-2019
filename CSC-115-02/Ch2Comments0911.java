// Chapter 2 Notes: Comments 

public class Ch2Comments {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        comments();  // in this method we will explore comments
    }
    
    // a method to investigate comments
    public static void comments()  {
        
        // anything you type in a comment will be ignored by the compiler/computer
        
        // We use comments for:
        // -Adding your name to the program 
        // -Adding a brief description of the program 
        // -As you go along, to explain to others (and yourself) what your code should do
        
        // Also... DEBUGGING 
        // If there is code that doesn't quite work yet... 
        // If there are a bunch of lines of code that don't work and you want to isolate them 
        
        // GIVE CREDIT 
        // If you use someone else's code, use comments to credit them 
        // and include the place where you got it from 
        // ex. shamelessly stolen from http://github.com/awesomecoder 
        
        // HOW DO WE MAKE COMMENTS?
        // Line comments: anything that comes after // is ignored by the compiler 
        // Block comment: /* */ (slash star star slash)  (comment sandwich)
        // Java Doc comment: /** */ (will automatically generate code documentation - we won't use)
        
        // Examples:
        
        /* When you have multiple lines of code 
           that you want to comment out 
           you can use a block comment 
           and put as many lines as you want.
           Good for name/description at the top of programs.
