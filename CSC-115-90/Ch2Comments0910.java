        // We comments for:
        // -Adding your name to the program 
        // -Adding a brief description of the program 
        // -As you go along, explain to others (and yourself) what your code should do
        
        // Also... DEBUGGING
        // If there is code that doesn't quite work yet...
        // If there are a bunch of lines of code that have an error that you want to 
        // isolate
        
        // GIVE CREDIT 
        // If you use someone else's code, use comments to credit them and include 
        // the place where you got it from 
        // ex. shamelessy stolen from http://github.com/awesomecoder
        
        // HOW DO WE MAKE COMMENTS?
        // Line comments: anything after the // is ignored by the compiler
        // Block comment:  /*  */ (slash star star slash) (comment sandwich)
        // Java Doc comments: /** */ (will automatically generate documentation- 
        // we won't use much)
        
        // Examples
        
        /* When you have multiple lines of comments
           it's helpful to do a block comment because
           you can add as many lines as you want.
           Good for use at top - name/description.
